int(x)
Negative floats are always rounded UP to the closest integer (for instance, both -1.1 and -1.9 are rounded up to -1). Positive floats are always rounded DOWN to the closest integer (for instance, 2.1 and 2.9 are rounded down to 2).

When you multiple an integer or float by a boolean with value True, it just returns that same integer or float (and is equivalent to multiplying by 1). If you multiply an integer or float by a boolean with value False, it always returns 0. This is true for both positive and negative numbers. If you multiply a string by a boolean with value True, it just returns that same string. And if you multiply a string by a boolean with value False, it returns an empty string (or a string with length zero).
